         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>RIght Reverend Father in God, We Greet you well. Whereas the Advancement of the Honour and Service of Almighty God, and of the Proteſtant Religion, which by his wonderful Providence hath been preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eſtabliſhed in theſe Kingdoms, ought to be the chief part of Our Royal Care: In Order to this, as We have oftentimes Declared, That We would take the Church of <hi>England</hi> by Law Eſtabliſhed, into Our particular Protection and Favour; So We take this Occaſion to Renew theſe Aſſurances, being Reſolved to do all We can for the Support and Strengthning of it; Preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withal the Liberty of Concience to all Our other Proteſtant Subjects, which by Our Laws they now Enjoy.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the Welfare, Peace and Honour of this Church depends ſo much upon all Perſons faithfully doing their Duties in their ſeveral Places and Functions, We therefore Firſt of all Charge and Require you the Biſhops of this Our Church, to apply your ſelves with all Diligence and Zeal to the Duties of your Epiſcopal Function, according to the Word of God, the Orders of this Church, and the Laws of this Our Realm.</p>
            <p>More eſpecially as to Ordination of Miniſters, We Require you to uſe all poſſible Care and Strictneſs, in Examining and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the Lives and Learning of ſuch Perſons as deſire to be admitted into Holy Orders, and herein conſtantly to obſerve the <note n="*" place="margin">Can. 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36.</note> Canons relating thereunto, the Neglect whereof We ſhall ſtrictly Enquire into, and take Care that it be Puniſhed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law.</p>
            <p>We alſo Charge and Require you to keep a ſtrict Watch over all the Clergy in your reſpective Dioceſſes, to ſee that they be duly Reſident upon their Livings according to the Laws in that Caſe provided, and that there they be Conſtant and Diligent in their Duties, performing the Publick Offices of Worſhip Gravely and Devoutly, Preaching the Word of God Plainly and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, without running into needleſs Controverſies, and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the Holy Sacraments Frequently, with that Reverence which is due to the Inſtitutions of Chriſt; Alſo Catechizing the Youth, Viſiting the Sick and Diſtreſſed, and doing all ſuch Things in their Stations as may tend to promote the Honour of God and True Religion, together with Peace and Charity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all their Neighbours; Themſelves giving a good Example to their Flock, by walking before them in all Holy Converſation and Godlineſs.</p>

And the more effectually to prevent the Scandals that may ariſe by any Diſorders in the Lives of thoſe who ought to be Examples to others, you ſhall Admoniſh them Religionſly to obſerve the <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Can.</hi> 75.</note> Canon Entitled, <hi>Sober Conſideration required in Miniſters.</hi> And you ſhall Severely and Impartially proceed by Eccleſiaſtical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, againſt all ſuch of your Clergy as ſhall be found guilty of any Notorious Violation of this or any other Law or Canon relating to their Duty.</p>
            <p>And for the better Encouragement of Deſerving Men, as We in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make it a Rule to Our Self, ſo We alſo Require it of you, in Diſpoſing of Church Preferments, to have a ſpecial Regard to ſuch Perſons as by their Piety, Learning, Diligence and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, do moſt promote the Honour of God, and the Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Church.</p>
            <p>And becauſe, as Our Duty requires, We moſt earneſtly deſire and ſhall endeavour a General Reformation of the Lives and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of all Our Subjects, as being that which muſt Eſtabliſh Our Throne, and ſecute to Our People their Religion, Happineſs and Peace; all which ſeem to be in great Danger at this time, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that overflowing of Vice, which is too notorious in this, as well as other Neighbouring Nations. We therefore require you to Order all the Clergy to Preach frequently againſt thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sins and Vices which are moſt prevailing in this Realm; And that on every of thoſe Lords Days on which any ſuch Sermon is to be Preach'd, they do alſo Read to their People ſuch Statute Law or Laws as are provided againſt that Vice or Sin, which is their Subject on that Day, as namely, againſt <note n="*" place="margin">21 <hi>Iac.</hi> Cap. 10.</note> Blaſphemy, Swearing and Curſing; Againſt <note n="†" place="margin">5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Cap. 9.</note> Perjury; againſt <note n="‖" place="margin">4 <hi>Iac.</hi> Cap. 5.2. <hi>Iac.</hi> Cap. 7.</note> Drunkenneſs; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note>PLACE="marg" n="*" 29 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. Cap. 7.</note> Prophanation of the Lords Day: All which Statutes We have Ordered to be Printed together with theſe Our Letters, that ſo they may be Tranſmitted by you to every Pariſh within this Our Realm.</p>
            <p>And whereas there is as yet no ſufficient Proviſion by any Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute law for the Puniſhing of Adultery and Fornication, You ſhall therefore require all Church-Wardens in your Dioceſſes to Preſent impartially all thoſe that are guilty of any ſuch Crimes in their ſeveral Pariſhes; And upon ſuch Preſentments, We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you to proceed without delay, and upon ſufficient proof to inflict thoſe Cenſures which are appointed by Our Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Laws againſt ſuch Offenders: In doing whereof, according to your Duty, you ſhall not want Our effectual Aſſiſtance and Support.</p>
            <p>And for the better Carrying on of ſo good a Work, We do in the laſt place, Charge and Require you to Preach frequently your ſelves, to Confer often with your Clergy, and to Enquire by all proper means into all Abuſes and Corruptions in your Dioceſſes, in order to a full and ſpeedy Reformation. And all this, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as you ſhall Anſwer it to Us, but alſo as conſidering the great Charge that God hath Committed to you, and the Account that you muſt give him for it at the Great Day. And ſo We bid you heartily Farewel.</p>
